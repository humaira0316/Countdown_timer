Countdown Timer

This Python application is a simple graphical countdown timer. It allows users to input a specific time and start a countdown, providing a desktop notification when the time is up. The application is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and utilizes threading for smooth operation.

Features

- User Input: Allows users to enter a countdown time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Start and Reset:Provides buttons to start the countdown and reset it if needed.
- Real-Time Display: Displays the remaining time in the format "Time: HH:MM:SS".
- Notification: Shows a desktop notification when the countdown reaches zero.

Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- `win10toast` for Windows toast notifications

You can install `win10toast` using pip:

pip install win10toast

Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Run the script:

  
   python countdown_timer.py
 

3. A window will appear with the following elements:
   - An entry field to input the time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
   - A "Start" button to begin the countdown.
   - A "Reset" button to stop the countdown and reset the timer.
   - A label displaying the remaining time.

4. Enter the desired countdown time and click "Start" to begin the timer. The remaining time will be updated every second.

5. When the timer reaches zero, a desktop notification will alert you that the time is up.

How It Works

- The GUI is created using the Tkinter library, with a main window set to a fixed size and a black background.
- User input is taken from the entry field, and the countdown is initiated by pressing the "Start" button.
- A separate thread is used to run the countdown, allowing the UI to remain responsive.
- The countdown is calculated in total seconds and displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds format.
- The "Reset" button stops the countdown and resets the display to "00:00:00".
